HTML looks like this:

```html
<html>
    ...
</html>
```
"..." is whatever that goes between those tags, omitted for brevity

You should view an HTML "file" as a "document". You will see why when we delve into JavaScript.

> **index.html**
>
>    HTML
>
>

What kind of files are also called documents? DOCX, aka Word documents.


And how do you read DOCX? With the application Microsoft Word.

So HTML, also a kind of document, is read by a **browser** instead of MS Word.
